# üîß ENVOY - Lightweight User Environment Manager

This tool automates the deployment or execution of configurations during logon on Windows machines. It is mainly built for Intune Managed devices where certain actions are not natively possible from Intune. During execution it connects to Microsoft Graph using an App Registration and grabs the group memberships from the user. The script performs tasks such as drive mapping, printer mapping, registry key management, File Actions (copy/move/delete/rename) and starts executables based on Entra ID group membership.

> Envoy is still in development. More information available soon!

# üöÄ Core Components

- **Microsoft Graph Authentication**: The script uses the `Microsoft.Graph` modules to interact with Microsoft Graph APIs.
- **Configuration File**: Reads settings from `Config.json` located at `C:\ProgramData\Envoy\Config.json`.
- **Authentication**: Connects to Microsoft Graph using `TenantId`, `AppId`, and `AppSecret` from the configuration file.

# üí• Functions

### üì∞ Write-Log

- **Purpose:** Logs messages to a user-specific log file located at `C:\ProgramData\Envoy\Logging\<username>\User.log`.

- **Key Features:** Ensures the log directory exists and appends timestamped log entries.

&nbsp;

### üìÅ Deploy-DriveMappings

**Purpose**: Maps or removes network drives based on configuration.

**Key Features:**
  - Reads drive mapping configurations from `Config.json`.
  - Checks user group memberships to determine eligibility.
  - Supports adding and removing drive mappings.
  - Logs success or failure of each operation.
  - Priority handling for situations with conflicting actions (e.g. same drive letters).

&nbsp;

**Example:**
```
"Drives": [
      {
        "DriveLetter": "X",
        "UNCPath": "\\\\storageaccount.file.core.windows.net\\share1",
        "Group": "GG - Share 1",
        "Description": "Test Drive",
        "Priority": 1,
        "Action": "add"
      },
      {
        "DriveLetter": "Y",
        "UNCPath": "\\\\fileserver\\share2",
        "Group": "GG - Share 2",
        "Description": "Test Drive 2",
        "Priority": 1,

## ‚úÖ Execution

The script executes the following tasks sequentially while logging on. The scheduled task created by `Envoy-core.ps1` will execute these functions.

1. **Drive Mapping**: Execute `Deploy-DriveMappings` to manage network drives.
2. **Registry Key Management**: Execute `Deploy-RegistryKeys` to manage registry keys.
3. **Process execution**: Execute `Deploy-ProcessExecution` to manage process executions.
4. **File Actions**: Execute `Deploy-FileActions` to manage file actions.
5. **Printer mapping**: Execute `Deploy-PrinterMappings` to manage printer mappings.
6. **All functions**: Execute `Invoke-UEMDeployment` to manage all functions at once.

&nbsp;

## ‚úÖ Delayed Execution


If you need to implement a delayed execution in your environment, you can customize the code accordingly. Locate `$delaySeconds` in the `Envoy-logon.ps1` file. Set the desired delay and remove any hashtags associated with the delay (which is disabled by default).

&nbsp;

## üîÉ Envoy Refresh

Configurations can be refreshed during an active user session. A shortcut in the public start menu allows you to re-launch Envoy. All configurations will be reassessed and executed by referencing the Config.JSON file.

![Refresh](Common/EnvoyRefresh.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies

Requires the following PowerShell modules. Installation will be handled by `Envoy-core.ps1`.

- `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Groups`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Users`

&nbsp;

> [!NOTE]
> Installation of these modules is being handled by Envoy-core.ps1 or either an installation method (e.g. MSI). This has yet to be defined.
