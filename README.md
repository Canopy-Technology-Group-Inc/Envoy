# ENVOY - Lightweight User Environment Manager

This tool automates the deployment or execution of configurations during logon on Windows machines. It is mainly built for Intune Managed devices where certain actions are not natively possible from Intune. During execution it connects to Microsoft Graph using an App Registration and grabs the group memberships from the user. The script performs tasks such as drive mapping, printer mapping, registry key management, File Actions (copy/move/delete/rename) and starts executables based on Entra ID group membership.

&nbsp;

## ‚úÖ Execution

The script executes the following tasks sequentially while logging on. The scheduled task created by `Envoy.msi` will execute these functions.

1. **Drive Mapping**: Execute `Deploy-DriveMappings` to manage network drives.
2. **Registry Key Management**: Execute `Deploy-RegistryKeys` to manage registry keys.
3. **Process execution**: Execute `Deploy-ProcessExecution` to manage process executions.
4. **File Actions**: Execute `Deploy-FileActions` to manage file actions.
5. **Printer mapping**: Execute `Deploy-PrinterMappings` to manage printer mappings.
6. **All functions**: Execute `Invoke-UEMDeployment` to manage all functions at once.

&nbsp;

## ‚úÖ Delayed Execution


If you need to implement a delayed execution in your environment, you can customize the code accordingly. Locate `$delaySeconds` in the `Envoy-logon.ps1` file. Set the desired delay and remove any hashtags associated with the delay (which is disabled by default).

&nbsp;

## üîÉ Envoy Refresh

Configurations can be refreshed during an active user session. A shortcut in the public start menu allows you to re-launch Envoy. All configurations will be reassessed and executed by referencing the Config.JSON file.

![Refresh](Images/EnvoyRefresh.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies

Requires the following PowerShell modules. Installation will be handled by the MSI installer. If required modules are already installed it will skip the installation. Otherwise it will download and install the latest version of these modules.

- `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Groups`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Users`

&nbsp;

# üíª Installation

Complete the following steps to set up Envoy correctly in your environment.

## App registration

Envoy retrieves user and group membership information from Microsoft Entra ID via Microsoft Graph. It uses the Microsoft.Graph.Authentication, Microsoft.Graph.Groups, and Microsoft.Graph.Users modules to access and query directory data. Envoy requires an App Registration with the appropriate Graph API permissions. Authentication credentials (*including the Client ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret*) are stored in the `Config.json` file, enabling automated access to Entra ID for reporting or auditing purposes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Config.json` file is stored locally on the device. As a result, anyone with access to the file‚Äôs location can potentially view the Client ID and Secret. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to grant the App Registration only the minimum required permissions.

**1. Create the App registration:** Go to https://entra.microsoft.com/ -> Identity -> Applications -> App registrations -> New registration.

![EntraAppReg1](Images/AppReg1.png)

**2. Fill in the desired App registration name:** For example Envoy. Select Single tenant and click Create.

![EntraAppReg2](Images/AppReg2.png)

**3. Click on New client secret:** Fill in the desired name and an required secret lifetime.

![EntraAppReg3](Images/AppReg3.png)

**4. Write down the following information:**

  -	Secret ID
  -	Value
  -	Application ID

![EntraAppReg4](Images/AppReg4.png)

**5. Set required API permissions:** Microsoft Graph
  -	Group.Read.All (Application)
  -	GroupMember.Read.All (Application)
  -	User.Read (Delegated)
  -	User.Read.All (Application)

![EntraAppReg5](Images/AppReg5.png)

## Install Envoy
Visit the official releases page: üëâ https://github.com/j0eyv/Envoy/releases

Look for the latest release at the top of the page (marked with a ‚ÄúLatest‚Äù label). Under the Assets section of that release, click the .msi file (e.g., Envoy.msi) to download the Windows installer. Once downloaded, distribute the MSI installation to your managed endpoints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The installation **must** be installed in `C:\ProgramData\Envoy`. Using a different location might break the entire product.

The installation process is simple‚Äîjust run the MSI file manually to start the setup. For bulk or unattended deployments, it's recommended to use silent installation parameters for automation. Therefor, use `msiexec /i "C:\Path\To\Envoy.msi" /qn /norestart`. While using **Intune**, you can simply distribute Envoy via the available methods.

- `/i Envoy.msi`: Installs the MSI package named Envoy.msi.
- `/qn`: Quiet mode with no UI.
- `/norestart`: Prevents the installer from restarting the system.

## Configure Envoy

Once distributed, we only need to make sure the `Config.JSON` file is being used is filled correctly. The default config file that comes with the installation is mainly filled with examples. Important part of the `Config.JSON` file is the tenant configuration. Make sure the Entra ID configuration matches the newly created App registration from the steps before. We **DO** need the the following information:

```
  "Configuration": {
    "Entra": {
      "TenantId": "42ba3ed1-ae78-****-****-************",
      "AppId": "aed0ab9a-963e-****-****-***********",
      "AppSecret": "0d08Q~uOmVlERx_***************-"
    },
```

See the the detailed [documentation](#-functions) for configuration examples.

&nbsp;

## Centralized distribution

There are several ways to manage and distribute a centralized `Config.JSON`, and the best approach depends entirely on your existing infrastructure and the tools it supports. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no universal solution that satisfies all use cases and security best practices. Therefore, we provide a few potential options that you will need to implement yourself. It's important to evaluate each option carefully, as some may have limitations or may not fully align with recommended security practices.
